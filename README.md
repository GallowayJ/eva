# Generalized extreme value utils

This package contains code to scrape, parse, tidy and visualise data from the Met Officeâ€™s historical station data.
In general, classes create dictionaries where the key is the station name and the value is a `pandas.DataFrame` of measurements.
Most methods update these DataFrames inplace, however in cases where methods perform a task where is not correct or improve format, a similar object to arg will be returned.
For example, in the case of creating a dictionary where values of station extreme values (annual maxima), instead of overwrite a instance attribute, a new dictionary will be returned.

For plotting utils, in general data in addition to a `matplotlib.pyplot` fig and ax(es) objects are require and the fig and ax(es) will always be returned allowing for further customization.
